# Inventory

## Description

An international inventory management system that maintains lists of parts (made in-house and outsourced) and products with associated parts. The application provides functionality to add, modify, or delete part/product. 
Products can only be deleted when no parts are associated with it. main screen of the app includes two tables for parts and products, including a unique ID, item name, number 
of items in the inventory, and price per unit. It includes search functionality for the tables.

The application implements the MVC pattern using JavaFX. All changes to the parts and products are submitted after a user confirms the action through a confirmation window. 
Incorrect input handling has also been implemented by design and is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Parts:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Name cannot be only numbers.</li>
      <li>Minimum number of parts used cannot be larger than maximum.</li>
      <li>Stock must be a number.</li>
      <li>Price must be a number, the app doesn't allow other input than a number.</li>
      <li>Company name for outsourced parts cannot contain only numbers.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Products</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Name cannot be only numbers.</li>
        <li>Minimum number of parts used cannot be larger than maximum.</li>
        <li>Price must be a number, the app doesn't allow other input than a number.</li>
      </ul>
</ul>
